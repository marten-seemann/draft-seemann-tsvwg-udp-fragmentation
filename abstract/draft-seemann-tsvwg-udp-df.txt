    Configuring UDP Sockets for Don't Fragment for Common Platforms
                   draft-seemann-tsvwg-udp-df-latest

Abstract

   When performing Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) over UDP, applications
   must prevent fragmentation of UDP datagrams both by the sender's
   kernel and during network transit.  This document provides guidance
   for implementers on configuring socket options to prevent
   fragmentation of IPv4 and IPv6 packets across commonly used
   platforms.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC0791] defines the Don't Fragment (DF) bit in the IPv4 header.
   When set, this bit prevents routers from fragmenting IP packets.  If
   a router needs to fragment a packet with the DF bit set, it will
   instead drop the packet and send an ICMP "fragmentation needed"
   message back to the sender.

   The DF bit has historically been most relevant to TCP ([RFC9293]),
   where the kernel handles Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) internally.
   Applications using TCP sockets do not need to interact with the DF
   bit directly.

   In IPv6 ([RFC8200]), fragmentation by intermediate nodes is not
   permitted.  All IPv6 packets effectively have the DF bit set,
   however, the endpoint's kernel might still break up UDP datagrams
   that are too large to fit the MTU of the interface before sending a
   packet into the network.

   [RFC8899] defines Datagram Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery
   (DPLPMTUD), a mechanism that allows protocols running over UDP to
   determine the maximum packet size they can send.  Setting the DF bit
   is crucial for DPLPMTUD, as it ensures that packets larger than the
   Path MTU are dropped, allowing the endpoint to detect the MTU
   limitation.

   QUIC [RFC9000] is one such protocol that runs over UDP and make use
   of DPLPMTUD.  As QUIC implementations typically run in user space,
   they need to configure the DF bit on their UDP sockets to perform
   DPLPMTUD correctly.

   This document provides guidance for implementers on how to set the DF
   bit on UDP sockets across different platforms.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Setting the DF bit

   While routers don't fragment IPv6 packets in transit, the sender's
   kernel will still fragment UDP datagrams that are too large to fit
   the MTU of the interface before sending a packet into the network.
   Therefore, operating systems offer socket options to control the
   fragmentation behavior for IPv6 packets.

   For user-space implementations of DPLPMTUD, applications need to set
   the DF bit on IPv4 sockets and prevent fragmentation on IPv6 sockets.

3.1.  Linux

   Linux uses the socket option of level IPPROTO_IP with name
   IP_MTU_DISCOVER with value IP_PMTUDISC_DO for IPv4.

   For IPv6, IPV6_MTU_DISCOVER with a value of IPV6_PMTUDISC_DO is used
   for the IPPROTO_IPV6 level.

   For dual-stack sockets, both socket options can be set independently.

3.2.  Apple

   For IPv4, Apple platforms use the socket option of level IPPROTO_IP
   with name IP_DONTFRAG with value 1.  For IPv6, IPV6_DONTFRAG with
   value 1 is used for the IPPROTO_IPV6 level.

   However, dual-stack sockets are handled differently: To open a dual-
   stack socket, an IPv6 socket needs to be opened and the IPV6_V6ONLY
   option needs to be set to 0.  This enables the socket to send both
   IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  IPv4 packets must be sent using an
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.

   When using a dual-stack socket, it is only necessary (and possible)
   to set the IPV6_DONTFRAG socket option.  This results in the DF bit
   being set when sending IPv4 packets.  It is not possible to control
   the fragmentation behavior of IPv4 and IPv6 separately.

3.3.  Windows

   For IPv4, Windows uses the socket option of level IPPROTO_IP with
   name IP_DONTFRAGMENT with value 1.  For IPv6, IPV6_DONTFRAG with
   value 1 is used for the IPPROTO_IPV6 level.

   Similar to the Apple platforms, dual-stack sockets are IPv6 sockets
   with the IPV6_V6ONLY option set to 0.  IPv4 packets must be sent
   using an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.  However, contractary to Apple
   platforms, the DF bit on IPv4 packets is controlled by the
   IP_DONTFRAGMENT socket option.
